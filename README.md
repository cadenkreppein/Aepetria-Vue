# Aepetria-Vue

## Description
This is a Vue implementation of my homebrew D&D world, Aepetria's, website. If you play in one of my campaigns, get out of here! Go make sure you've levelled up your character!

## Technical Details
Front end is managed via Vue CLI 4.x, backend is a .NET Core API hosted via AWS. No TypeScript because I prefer the design patterns of JS. Axios is used for AJAX calls.
