          <h2 class="text-center">The LaCroix Bois</h2>
          <p>
            These boistrous brothers only have one thing on their mind: gold. Purveyors of fine sparkling water, they seek to strike it rich by peddling
            their wares to the thirsty inhabitants of Aepetria.
          </p>
          <h4 class="text-center">Perrier (Perry) LaCroix</h4>
          <p>
            The <s>older</s> younger (and more fabulous) of the two, Perry learned magic at the behest of his strict and demanding father. The LaCriox bois
            always resented their father, but no one could question his magical prowess. Perhaps the harsh treatment from his father is why Perry turned
            out so... flamboyant.
          </p>
          <h4 class="text-center">Pellegrino (Pelle) LaCroix</h4>
          <p>
            The <s>younger</s> older of the two, Pelle took more after his mother. She was a carefree soul unlike her coarse husband, and Pelle learned to
            channel her lovely spirit through joyous performanace. Maybe a bit too much.
          </p>
          <h2 class="text-center">Jayla Reevis</h2>
          <p>
            A rocky childhood and irresponsible parents drove Jayla to learn self-defense at a young age. She's traveled eastward to make enough gold to
            settle a family debt, and when the lands are as wild as Aepetria, there's always plenty of headhunting to go around.
          </p>
          <h2 class="text-center">Xel</h2>
          <p>
            An aspiring poet and fearsome fighter, the dragonborn named Xel is the current wielder of the God-Slaying Sword, and certainly a worthy one at
            that. He's been learning bardic magics from Pelle, and is well on his way to becoming adept in his magical skill... as soon as he can learn how
            to play his bagpipes.
          </p>
          <h2 class="text-center">Little Timmy (Moth)</h2>
          <p>
            Timmy was saved from a terrible fate by the gang at a young age, but was unfortunately taken from them by Asmodeus. Some time after these events,
            Timmy re-established contact with the gang and is now a vital source of information and combat power for the group.
